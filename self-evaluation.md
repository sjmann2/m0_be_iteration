# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
- **The `each` method was not one I felt confident in at all. I understood it on a basic level but when I tried to use it in practice I kept getting stuck.**
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- **I felt myself nearing the edge of unproductive struggle--I was doing this at the end of the night and not having much success answering my questions on google. Once I finally got to the point where I realized I didn't necessarily need all brand new methods and that I had some knowledge necessary to solve it, it definitely got back into productive struggle territory. Even though I had a rough start I still really enjoyed solving the problem and getting to use background knowledge to do so.**
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- **I think an issue that arose was having a narrow scope and assuming that solving the problem would only take the `each` method and the tools I had learned from the iteration lesson. Going forward I will know better and will draw from all of the knowledge I have learned so far!**
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
